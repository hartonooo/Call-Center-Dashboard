steps:

1. Open csv file and then extract it to new excel file

2. Check data for any inconsistent or missing values. We got:
	- six empty customer data -> we remove them
	- 19887 rows in call timestamp column have inconsistent date-month format --> create new column and fix it with date(year, month, day) function
		use this new column as call timestamp and remove previous call timestamp column
	
3. Check for any duplicates -> not found, everything looks fine

4. Select all data and format to table. So if there's any data updates, we just click refresh data

5. Split (and create new column) from call timestamp into day and month column. Use them as time filter in our dashboard

6. Split (and create new column) from call_center to city2 and state2. Use them as call center location in our dashboard

6. Create pivot tables on the new sheet, for: 

	- number of calls: put id to values, set to count, and rename to # Calls 

	- average satisfaction score: put csat_score to values, set to average, and rename it to Avg Satisfaction Score

	- average call duration: put call_duration_in_minutes to values, set to average, and rename it to Avg Call Duration (mins)

	- call trend: put month to rows and values, set to count, and rename it to Calls Trend -> on PivotTable Analyze tab -> PivotChart -> line chart with marker

	- call channel: put channel to rows and values, set to count, rename it to Calls Channel -> on PivotTable Analyze tab -> PivotChart -> pie -> doughnut

	- reason for calling: put reason to rows and values. set to count, rename it to Reason For Calling -> on PivotTable Analyze tab -> PivotChart -> column

	- response time: put response time to rows and columns, set to count, rename it to Response Time -> on PivotTable Analyze tab -> PivotChart -> bar

	- call center loc: put city2 to rows and values, set to count, rename it to Call Center Loc -> since we can't create map chart from pivot table, we copy values from pivot table
		and plot map chart from insert -> maps

7. set Dashboard sheet

8. copy and paste all pivot chart into Dashboard sheet, in PivotTable Analyze tab -> deselect Field Buttons to remove filter button on out chart

9. select any chart -> insert -> slicer -> select day, month, reason, channel, sentiment, call_center

10. for every slicer -> right click -> report connection -> check all 

11. arrange charts and slicer accordingly

11. improve visual of dashboard sheet (color, themes, etc)
